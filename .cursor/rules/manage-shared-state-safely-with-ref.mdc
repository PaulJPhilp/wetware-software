# Manage Shared State Safely with Ref
**Rule:** Use Ref to manage shared, mutable state concurrently, ensuring atomicity.

### Example
This program simulates 1,000 concurrent fibers all trying to increment a shared counter. Because we use `Ref.update`, every single increment is applied atomically, and the final result is always correct.

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Create a new Ref with an initial value of 0
  const ref = yield* Ref.make(0);

  // Define an effect that increments the counter by 1
  const increment = Ref.update(ref, (n) => n + 1);

  // Create an array of 1,000 increment effects
  const tasks = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => increment);

  // Run all 1,000 effects concurrently
  yield* Effect.all(tasks, { concurrency: "unbounded" });

  // Get the final value of the counter
  return yield* Ref.get(ref);
});

// The result will always be 1000
Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log);

```
