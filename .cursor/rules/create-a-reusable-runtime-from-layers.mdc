# Create a Reusable Runtime from Layers
**Rule:** Create a reusable runtime from layers.

### Example
```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Runtime } from "effect";

class GreeterService extends Effect.Service<GreeterService>()(
  "Greeter",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      greet: (name: string) => Effect.sync(() => `Hello ${name}`)
    })
  }
) {}

const runtime = Effect.runSync(
  Layer.toRuntime(GreeterService.Default).pipe(
    Effect.scoped
  )
);

// In a server, you would reuse `run` for every request.
Runtime.runPromise(runtime)(Effect.log("Hello"));
```

**Explanation:**  
By compiling your layers into a Runtime once, you avoid rebuilding the
dependency graph for every effect execution.
