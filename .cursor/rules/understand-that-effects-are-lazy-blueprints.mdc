# Understand that Effects are Lazy Blueprints
**Rule:** Understand that effects are lazy blueprints.

### Example
```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

console.log("1. Defining the Effect blueprint...");

const program = Effect.sync(() => {
  console.log("3. The blueprint is now being executed!");
  return 42;
});

console.log("2. The blueprint has been defined. No work has been done yet.");

Effect.runSync(program);
```

**Explanation:**  
Defining an `Effect` does not execute any code inside it. Only when you call `Effect.runSync(program)` does the computation actually happen.
