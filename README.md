# Wetware & Software

Welcome to the open-source repository for the "Wetware & Software" blog!

This space is dedicated to exploring the fascinating and often chaotic intersection of human systems and advanced AI. Here, we delve into new paradigms of collaboration between people and technology, offering a front-row seat to a revolution that transforms us from the inside out.

Authored by Paul Philp, a software/AI engineer, founder, and executive who'd be the haggard, grey-haired veteran of technology revolutionsâ€”if he wasn't bald.
