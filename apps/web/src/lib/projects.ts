    longDescription: `effect-notion is a lightweight, production-ready server that acts as a secure proxy for the Notion API. Built with the powerful Effect library, it provides a robust, type-safe, and efficient way to fetch data from Notion databases and pages.

Key features include:
â€¢ Secure Notion API Proxy: Safely access the Notion API without exposing your credentials on the client-side
â€¢ Rich Filtering Capabilities: Dynamically filter Notion database entries using a flexible JSON-based query language
â€¢ Logical Field Overrides: Decouple your application from your Notion schema by mapping Notion's field names to logical names
â€¢ Codegen for Type Safety: Generate TypeScript types from your live Notion database to ensure end-to-end type safety
â€¢ Built with Effect: Leverages the Effect library for a highly performant, concurrent, and error-resilient server
â€¢ Ready to Deploy: Includes configurations for easy deployment to services like Vercel
â€¢ Consistent Error Model: All errors return normalized JSON with a stable shape and a requestId for tracing

This server is ideal for developers building front-end applications (blogs, documentation sites, personal portfolios) that use Notion as a CMS. It acts as a secure and robust backend layer, abstracting away the complexities of the Notion API.`,
